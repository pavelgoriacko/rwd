# Introduction to Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE)

## Overview

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE), including definitions, significance, key applications, and major sources. This sets the stage for understanding how RWD can be responsibly and effectively used in clinical and translational research.

### Learning Objectives

* Define RWD and RWE
* Understand the importance of RWD in clinical and translational research
* Identify key applications of RWD and RWE
* Distinguish between different types of real-world data sources

## What is Real-World Data (RWD)?

Real-world data refers to data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources. Common types include:

* Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
* Medical claims and billing data
* Product and disease registries
* Patient-generated data (e.g., through mobile devices or surveys)
* Data from digital health technologies

Each have their distinct advantages and drawbacks and must be carefully evaluated for their fit to answer the research question at hand. 

## What is Real-World Evidence (RWE)?

Real-world evidence is the clinical evidence regarding the usage and potential benefits or risks of a medical product derived from analysis of RWD. It can support:

* Regulatory decision-making
* Clinical guideline development
* Health technology assessments
* Quality improvement

## Why is RWD Important?

* Complements traditional clinical trials by reflecting broader and more diverse patient populations
* Offers insights into real-world effectiveness, safety, and utilization
* Enables learning health systems to continuously improve care

## Applications of RWD and RWE

* Drug safety monitoring and post-market surveillance
* Comparative effectiveness research
* Observational studies to support hypothesis generation
* Pragmatic clinical trials
* Health equity research



## Limitations and Considerations

* Data quality and completeness
* Potential biases and confounding
* Privacy and governance issues
* Varying data structures and lack of standardization

## Summary

Real-world data and real-world evidence play an increasingly central role in modern clinical and translational research. Understanding their strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications is essential for designing impactful studies that improve health outcomes.
