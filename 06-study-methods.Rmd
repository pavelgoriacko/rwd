# Study Designs for Real-World Evidence Generation

## Overview

Once a computable phenotype has been defined and validated, the next step in a real-world data (RWD) study is to apply that phenotype in the context of a well-designed research question. The goal is to generate valid, reliable real-world evidence (RWE) from observational data. This chapter introduces foundational study designs and frameworks that help researchers minimize bias and enhance the validity of their findings.

We focus primarily on **cohort studies** using **logic-based phenotyping**, which are the most common designs in RWD research. We also introduce basic graphical notation (e.g., DAGs) to illustrate key concepts.

## Learning Objectives

* Differentiate between major observational study designs.
* Describe key sources of bias in observational research.
* Explain the importance of the target trial emulation (TTE) framework.
* Understand how cohort studies are constructed in ATLAS.
* Identify techniques to mitigate confounding, selection bias, and measurement error.

## Observational Study Designs

There are several types of observational studies, each suited to different research questions and data contexts:

* **Cross-sectional studies**: Assess exposure and outcome at a single point in time.
* **Prospective cohort studies**: Follow individuals over time from a defined starting point.
* **Retrospective cohort studies**: Use historical data to define cohorts and follow-up periods.
* **Case-control studies**: Identify subjects with an outcome of interest (cases) and compare their prior exposures to those without the outcome (controls).

Among these, **cohort studies** are the most commonly used in real-world evidence generation, particularly when using common data models and tools like OHDSI's ATLAS.

## Key Challenges in Observational Research

Unlike randomized trials, observational studies face several threats to internal validity. The most common sources of bias include:

* **Confounding**: Differences in baseline characteristics between exposed and unexposed groups that affect outcomes.
* **Selection bias**: Systematic differences in who is included or excluded from the cohort.
* **Measurement error**: Misclassification of exposures, outcomes, or covariates, often due to limitations of real-world data sources or phenotype definitions.

## Cohort Studies

A **cohort** is a set of individuals who meet one or more inclusion criteria over a defined period. Cohort studies observe these individuals forward in time to assess the occurrence of outcomes. Importantly:

* A clinical trial is a type of cohort study with randomized exposure.
* In observational research, exposures are not randomly assigned, so careful design is essential to draw valid conclusions.

### Graphical Representation

Cohort entry and time-at-risk can be visualized using timelines. The following image shows how events are anchored to the **earliest qualifying event**, which determines cohort entry:

## Target Trial Emulation (TTE)

The **target trial emulation** framework encourages researchers to explicitly design their observational studies to mimic a hypothetical randomized trial. This includes defining:

* Eligibility criteria
* Treatment strategies
* Assignment procedures (hypothetical, in the observational context)
* Follow-up period
* Outcome definition
* Causal contrast of interest
* Analysis plan

TTE is especially useful for reducing **selection bias** and clarifying the timing of exposures and outcomes—often referred to as **time zero**.

## The ATLAS Framework

OHDSI’s **ATLAS** platform provides a visual interface for constructing cohort-based studies. It enables:

* Defining exposure and outcome cohorts using logic-based phenotyping.
* Specifying time-at-risk windows.
* Visualizing inclusion/exclusion criteria.
* Exporting study specifications for execution in distributed network studies.

ATLAS helps standardize study designs and encourages reproducibility by aligning closely with the TTE framework.

## Addressing Bias and Threats to Validity

### Selection Bias

* Choose time zero carefully (e.g., date of diagnosis vs. date of treatment).
* Use the TTE framework to clearly define eligibility and avoid immortal time bias.
* Assess how inclusion/exclusion criteria affect generalizability.

### Confounding

* Identify confounders using domain expertise and tools like DAGs.
* Address confounding using:

  * Stratification
  * Matching (e.g., propensity score)
  * Multivariable regression
  * Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)

### Measurement Error

* Evaluate the performance characteristics of phenotype definitions.
* Use sensitivity and specificity estimates to adjust results or interpret limitations.
* Conduct **quantitative bias analysis** when feasible.

### Additional Tools

* **Sensitivity analyses**: Test robustness of results under varying assumptions.
* **P-value calibration**: Adjust for multiple testing and observational bias.
* **Positive and negative controls**: Benchmark your design against known outcomes.

## Summary

Designing a high-quality RWD study requires more than defining a cohort—it demands attention to bias, careful emulation of randomized trials, and thoughtful evaluation of validity. Cohort studies, supported by the TTE framework and tools like ATLAS, provide a powerful foundation for generating credible real-world evidence when designed and executed rigorously.
