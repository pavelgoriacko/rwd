## Disclaimer

This book is a **living draft** and part of an ongoing effort to make real-world data (RWD) methods more accessible to clinician-researchers. We are sharing it publicly as part of a “work in public” philosophy—prioritizing openness, collaboration, and early feedback over polished perfection.

As such, please be aware of the following:

* **The content is incomplete.** Many sections are still in development, and you may encounter missing examples, rough outlines, or placeholders.
* **There may be inaccuracies.** Some statements have not yet been fully reviewed or fact-checked. Do not treat this draft as a definitive reference.
* **Formatting and organization are evolving.** You may notice inconsistencies in layout, language, or style as we continue editing and revising the material.
* **Citations may be informal or missing.** While we aim to acknowledge relevant prior work, we may reference ideas or studies without formal citations in early drafts. All sources will be properly cited in a final, polished version.
* **The content may change frequently.** Sections may be restructured, rewritten, or replaced as the work progresses and as we receive input from peers and collaborators.

This draft is not intended to serve as a formal educational resource or authoritative guide—at least not yet. Instead, it is a starting point for discussion. We are sharing it early because we believe that better ideas emerge when development is open, visible, and collaborative.

If you have suggestions, corrections, or feedback, we’d love to hear from you. Whether you are a researcher, educator, student, or practitioner, your perspective can help us shape this book into a more useful and rigorous resource for the community.

Thank you for joining us in this process.
