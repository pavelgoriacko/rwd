# Expanding the Boundaries of Real-World Data: Special Topics and Emerging Frontiers

Real-world data (RWD) research is evolving rapidly, encompassing an expanding array of clinical domains, data types, and methodological innovations. This chapter explores specialized contexts where RWD is either uniquely promising or especially challenging. These include rare diseases, synthetic controls for single-arm trials, wearable devices, underrepresented clinical areas, high-dimensional data types like waveforms and imaging, and unstructured text from clinical notes. Each section highlights both the potential and the pitfalls of working in these domains, along with practical and ethical considerations for researchers.

## Rare Diseases and Small Populations

Rare diseases present distinct challenges for RWD research:

* **Misdiagnosis and underreporting**: Rare conditions are frequently misdiagnosed or miscoded, leading to fragmented or inaccurate data.
* **Limited data availability**: Most RWD sources lack the sample size needed for robust statistical analysis.
* **Reliance on registries**: Rare disease studies often depend on disease-specific registries or patient advocacy data sets, which may not be linked to broader EHR systems.

Researchers can address these challenges by:

* Sharing data across sites and building federated networks
* Using Bayesian or hierarchical models to borrow strength across subgroups
* Integrating genomic or family history data to refine case identification

## External Controls and Synthetic Comparators

RWD can be used to construct external control arms for single-arm clinical trials, particularly in oncology and rare diseases:

* **Approaches**: Propensity score matching, synthetic controls, and digital twins aim to create comparable non-intervention groups.
* **Risks**: Lack of protocol harmonization, unmeasured confounding, and differing outcome definitions can compromise validity.

To improve rigor:

* Pre-specify endpoints and inclusion criteria aligned with the trial
* Conduct sensitivity analyses and transparency reporting
* Use regulatory guidance to ensure acceptability

### Pocock Exchangeability Criteria and FDA Guidance for Externally Controlled Trials

In his 1976 paper, *The Combination of Randomized and Historical Controls in Clinical Trials*, Sir Richard Pocock outlined a set of conditions that must be met for a historical control group to be considered acceptable in clinical trials. These criteria ensure that the historical control group is comparable to the randomized treatment group, minimizing the risk of bias in treatment comparisons. These criteria remain relevant today, especially in externally controlled trials.

#### The Pocock Exchangeability Criteria
   **The acceptability of a historical control group requires that it meets the following conditions:**
   
   1. Such a group must have received a precisely defined standard treatment which must be the same as the treatment for the randomized controls.
   2. The group must have been part of a recent clinical study which contained the same requirements for patient eligibility.
   3. The methods of treatment evaluation must be the same.
   4. The distributions of important patient characteristics in the group should be comparable with those in the new trial.
   5. The previous study must have been performed in the same organization with largely the same clinical investigators.
   6. There must be no other indications leading one to expect differing results between the randomized and historical controls. For instance, more rapid accrual on the new study might lead one to suspect less enthusiastic participation of investigators in the previous study so that the process of patient selection may have been different.
   
   *Only if all these conditions are met can one safely use the historical controls as part of a randomized trial. Otherwise, the risk of a substantial bias occurring in treatment comparisons cannot be ignored.*


#### FDA Guidance for Externally Controlled Trials

The **FDA guidance** on externally controlled trials further refines the conditions necessary for using external control arms in clinical trials. The FDA has highlighted several important factors that ensure the validity of externally controlled trials, including historical controls and other forms of external comparators. Below are some key considerations taken from the FDA’s 2023 guidance:

1. **Address differences in clinical care over time**, ensuring comparable timeframes between treatment arms and external control arms to aid in interpreting study findings.
2. **Consider variations in standards of care and healthcare access across regions**. Strive for a balance in participant distribution to reduce confounding effects, as regional differences can influence treatment outcomes.
3. **Ensure diagnostic criteria are consistent across compared arms** to reduce bias from changes in diagnostic practices. Differences in how conditions are diagnosed can introduce biases in treatment comparisons.
4. **Evaluate and ensure sufficient similarity in prognostic factors between participants in the treatment and external control arms**. This includes factors such as disease stage and baseline health conditions.
5. **Ensure attributes of the treatment (formulation, dose, route, timing, frequency, and adherence) are comparable between treatment arms and the external control arm**. Variations in treatment administration can confound results.
6. **Consider previous treatments, concomitant medications, and predictive biomarkers that could influence outcomes**. These factors should be accounted for to ensure comparability between groups.
7. **Ensure the designation of index dates and follow-up durations are consistent across treatment and external control arms**. Differences in follow-up periods can distort treatment effect comparisons.
8. **Assess and account for the impact of intercurrent events (e.g., additional therapies) on treatment outcomes**. These events can alter the course of treatment and influence outcomes.
9. **Ensure endpoints are consistently measured and comparable across treatment arms and the external control arm**. Differences in how outcomes are measured can introduce biases.
10. **Assess and manage the extent of missing data to minimize bias and ensure data comparability**. Missing data can lead to inaccurate conclusions if not appropriately handled.

These additional FDA guidelines further enhance Pocock's criteria, offering a broader framework for ensuring the validity of externally controlled trials that rely on RWD. Adhering to these criteria helps ensure that externally controlled trials generate reliable and valid results.

## Wearables and Device-Generated Data

Wearable sensors and devices produce continuous, high-frequency data on activity, vital signs, and behaviors:

* **Challenges**:

  * Data is typically generated outside clinical settings and stored in proprietary formats
  * There is often no standard way to integrate it into the EHR
  * Quality can vary based on context and user behavior

* **Opportunities**:

  * Detect early clinical deterioration
  * Understand behavior and adherence
  * Supplement traditional clinical endpoints with real-time patient-generated data

Researchers should consider working with informaticians and engineers to develop pipelines for cleaning, summarizing, and contextualizing device data.

## Underrepresented Clinical Domains

Certain clinical areas are poorly represented in mainstream RWD research:

* **Dentistry**: Often stored in separate systems with limited linkage to medical EHRs
* **Ophthalmology**: Relies heavily on imaging and specialized documentation tools
* **Behavioral health**: Data may be narrative, coded differently, or subject to higher privacy protections

To make progress:

* Use domain-specific vocabularies and standards (e.g., SNODENT, DICOM)
* Work with specialists to interpret data in context
* Explore crosswalks and linkage strategies between clinical domains

## High-Dimensional and Non-Tabular Data Types

RWD is increasingly incorporating non-tabular data:

* **Waveform data**: EKGs, EEGs, and respiratory signals often stored as raw time-series data
* **Imaging data**: CT, MRI, and retinal imaging can contain rich diagnostic information

These data types require:

* Specialized infrastructure for storage and compute
* Advanced analysis methods (e.g., signal processing, computer vision, deep learning)
* Integration with clinical context for labeling and interpretation

## Clinical Notes and Unstructured Text

Free-text clinical documentation contains essential insights not captured in structured fields:

* **Advantages**:

  * Provides reasoning, nuance, and context
  * Captures social, behavioral, and environmental factors
* **Challenges**:

  * Inconsistent language, misspellings, and abbreviations
  * Difficult to deidentify reliably
  * Requires NLP techniques for extraction

Effective use of clinical notes involves:

* Applying natural language processing (NLP) methods such as named entity recognition, negation detection, and temporal reasoning
* Validating text-derived features against structured data
* Balancing extraction quality with privacy protection
