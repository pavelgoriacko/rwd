# Sources of Real-World Data

## Overview

This chapter covers the primary sources of real-world data (RWD), highlighting their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and appropriate use cases in clinical and translational research.

### Learning Objectives

* Understand the major categories of RWD sources.
* Compare the advantages and limitations of different data sources.
* Identify appropriate use cases for each source of RWD.
* Recognize the implications of data provenance for study design and interpretation.

## Categories of RWD Sources

### Electronic Health Records (EHR)

* Captured during routine clinical care.
* Structured data (e.g., lab results, diagnosis codes) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes).
* Source for detailed clinical information and longitudinal patient histories.
* Limitations: data quality, missingness, variation across systems, not collected for research purposes.

### Administrative Claims Data

* Generated for billing and reimbursement purposes.
* Includes information on diagnoses, procedures, and prescriptions.
* National coverage (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers).
* Strengths: standardization, large populations, consistent coding.
* Limitations: lacks clinical detail, potential miscoding.

### Registries

* Disease-specific or procedure-specific data collections.
* Often curated with specific inclusion criteria and data standards.
* Examples: cancer registries, transplant registries.
* High-quality and structured, but may lack generalizability.

### Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD)

* Includes data from wearable devices, apps, home monitoring tools.
* Provides real-time insights outside of clinical settings.
* Challenges: data volume, reliability, integration with clinical systems.

### Other Sources

* Public health surveillance databases.
* Social determinants of health datasets.
* Biobanks and genomic databases.
* Data from pragmatic trials and learning health systems.

## Comparing Sources

| Data Source | Strengths                            | Limitations                              | Best Use Cases                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| EHR         | Rich clinical data, longitudinal     | Incomplete, messy, variable              | Clinical outcomes, phenotyping                 |
| Claims      | Large scale, consistent coding       | Limited clinical granularity             | Utilization, economic outcomes                 |
| Registries  | Focused, high-quality data           | Selection bias, limited population scope | Quality improvement, comparative effectiveness |
| PGHD        | Real-world behavior, continuous data | Variable quality, integration challenges | Adherence, behavior monitoring                 |

## Considerations for Researchers

* **Provenance**: Understand who collected the data, how, and for what purpose (further discussed in chapter __).
* **Data Quality**: Assess missingness, timeliness, accuracy, and validation (further discussed in chapter __).
* **Access and Governance**: Determine legal, ethical, and institutional requirements (further discussed in chapter __).
* **Population Representativeness**: Understand which groups may be underrepresented (further discussed in chapter __).

## Summary

* Different RWD sources serve different research needs.
* Understanding their provenance, structure, and limitations is key to rigorous study design.
* Triangulation of multiple data sources may improve validity but introduces additional complexity.
